	stop and wait protocol
for noiseless channel
unidirectional transmisssion
no error correction
sender waits for ack after sending each frame
Algo:
	sender: 1. send one packet at a time
			2. send next packet after recieving ack
	reciver: 1.recieve packet and send ack
adv: simple
disadv: dead slow, transmission stuck due to lost packet or ack, no handling of delayed data/ack

	Stop and wait ARQ(auto repeat req)
added handling for packet loss
if ack not recieved till 3RTT sender again sends the frame
4 possibilities
1. normal
2. frame lost
3. ack lost
4. ack recieved after timer expired(delay)
drawbacks:
	dead slow one frame at a time
	poor utilization of bandwidth

	Sliding window
multiple frames sent at once
each frame is numbered
no packet loss handling

	Go back N 
entire window is resent on packet loss

	selective repeat
only the lost frame is resent
reciever can send negative ack of packet are out of order
